This is an example case corresponding in the paper "李志锴,魏莎,丁虎,等.平直翼飞翼布局飞机的操稳特性[J].上海大学学报(自然科学版),2024,30(05):925-937.". 

Data of some of the configurations are not useful and thus not uploaded, so the input file list may need to be edited. The directory's name may be a little bit wrong, e.g. `CG(0.45 -0.40)AoA(-10 +15)b0V12` corresponding to CGx = 0.045m (wrong here), CGz = -0.4m, AoA from -10 to +15 deg, Beta = 0 deg, speed V = 12m/s. 

The `.vsp3` file refers to airfoil file `TL54m1.dat`, and the dir of which may also need to be amended again.
